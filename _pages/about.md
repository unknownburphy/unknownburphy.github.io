## Summary

I am a graduate student in Data Science at Seoul National University, researching value alignment in LLMs under Professor Yohan Jo. Currently, I'm particularly interested in two areas: assessing values in LLMs and reasoning in LLMs. I believe that aligning language models with specific value systems is a crucial first step toward building personalized AI systems.

## Research Interests

* Value-alignment in LLMs
* LLM reasoning
